# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **AWS SecretsManager provider** — `providers/secretsmanager` loads secrets
  eagerly at `Load()` time. `WithSecret` merges JSON-object secrets at the
  root; `WithSecretAtKey` nests a value at a dot-notation key. Client options
  mirror the rest of the Gas ecosystem (`WithRegion`, `WithStaticCredentials`,
  `WithEndpoint`, `WithClient`, `WithTimeout`).
- **`providers.ContextProvider`** — optional interface (`LoadContext(ctx)`);
  `Config.LoadWithContext` now passes its context to providers that
  implement it.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-02

First open source release. Versions prior to 0.3.0 were developed in a private
repository; this entry summarizes the package as published.

### Added

- **Early initialization** — `config.New()` returns `*Config` directly so
  configuration can be created and loaded before the rest of the app starts.
- **Providers** — `EnvProvider` (auto-registered by default), `JSONProvider`
  (with optional `fs.FS` support for embedded files), `DotEnvProvider`, and a
  `Provider` interface for custom sources. Later providers override earlier
  ones.
- **Hierarchical access** — dot-notation `Get`/`Find`/`Set`/`SetDefault` over
  nested configuration values, with `__`-separated env/`.env` keys mapping to
  nested maps.
- **Struct binding** via `Bind()`, matching `json` tags then case-insensitive
  field names, with support for all int/uint/float variants, bool, string,
  `time.Duration`, slices (including comma-separated strings), maps, and
  nested/embedded structs.
- **Validation** — `Bind()` integrates `go-playground/validator`, with
  `WithValidator` to supply a caller-owned instance (e.g. with custom tags
  registered) and `WithValidate(false)` to opt out per call.
- **Extensions** — `Extension` interface with `PreLoad`/`PostLoad` hooks, and
  a bundled `gas-env` extension for application environment detection
  (`Development`, `Testing`, `Staging`, `Production`) resolved from config
  providers, the `GAS_ENV` OS variable, or a configurable default.
- **`gas.ConfigProvider` implementation** for direct use in Gas apps via
  `gas.WithServiceInstance`.
- **`configtest` package** with `MockConfig` (structurally satisfies
  `gas.ConfigProvider`) and `NewMockConfigWithValues` for tests that need real
  `Get`/`Find`/`Bind` semantics seeded with known values.

### Fixed

- `DotEnvProvider` no longer mirrors `.env` entries into the live process
  environment by default, and when mirroring is explicitly enabled it skips
  security-relevant variables (`PATH`, `LD_PRELOAD`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`,
  `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`, `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and others), preventing a
  `.env` file from leaking secrets into child processes or overwriting
  dynamic-linker variables.
